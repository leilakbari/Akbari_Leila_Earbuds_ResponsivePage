## Installation
The 3D earbuds were originally designed in Cinema 4D and integrated with interactive hotspots using modelviewer.dev. The project uses HTML for content, CSS and SASS for responsive styling, and JavaScript to display detailed information about each component. The responsive design ensures an optimal viewing experience on desktops (1920 and 1200 ), tablets (768), and mobile (320) devices. 

## Usage

Click and rotate: Interact with the 3D model by clicking on the screen to rotate and explore the exterior of the earbuds in 3D.
Hotspots: Hover your mouse on each hotspot to reveal detailed descriptions of different earbuds components.
